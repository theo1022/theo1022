<h1>Welcome to my profile! I'm @theo1022</h1>
<p>My name is Theo Olsson, a graduate from <a href="https://ecutbildning.se/">EC Utbildning</a> in Gothenburg - Sweden where I studied to become a .NET developer</p>
<img id="EC" src="https://ecutbildning.se/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ec-logo-mono2.svg" alt="ec logo" style="width: 200px;">
<p>In fall of 2020 I took a course on the basics of C# after a suggestion from a friend and I quickly discovered that programing is something I greatly enjoy</p>
<p>I then started researching available schools in my area where I might enroll as a student.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my basic education had not given me a grade in the level of math needed to be enrolled in any of the schools and I had to crunch a math course in spring 2021 whilst also working to support myself. I recieved my grade with five days to spare to the deadline of application.</p>
<p>In the end this paid of, because I was accepted into my first choise of school in summer of 2021 and am expected to graduate in late spring of 2023</p>
<h3>During my studies I have the following courses:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>EF Core</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>Asp.NET Core</li>
  <li>Web API</li>
  <li>Agile system development</li>
  <li>CMS</li>
  <li>Systemintegration</li>
  <li>React</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I am an active problem solver who likes puzzles and logic puzzles where I can make things come together my favourite part so far has been developing backends with C# and logic with JS - though I do also enjoy the satisfaction of having things come together just right when using HTML and CSS</p>
